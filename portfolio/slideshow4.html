                <p>Here is a site that I am working on for Mirabella Doors, one of Houston's Premier Custom Doors providers. This project is still a work in progress, however, I felt that it was at a place where I could display it on my portfolio site in order to watch it evolve and grow.</p>

                <p>Pam Miller, owner and operator of Mirabella Doors, approached me with the idea of revamping her current site which one of her employees built on Weebly. While her employee did a wonderful job with the tools that Weebly provides, Pam was looking to take it to the next level with a completely custom design, look, and feel. Pretty straight forward from the outset, she wasn't needing an e-commerce store, rather a place to showcase her beautiful door designs in order bring in additional business.</p>

                <p>This site is being built using a combination HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Handlebars, JavaScript, and jQuery on the front-end, while Node.js, PHP, and Mongo DB are being used on the back-end. There are also numerous libraries and packages being used throughout to fill in the gaps.</p>

                <p>The main takeaway for this project is all about communication--being able to work collaboratively with your client helps set proper expectations, manage project timelines, and complete deliverables promised during the planning phase. As with any project, there are times where pivoting from the original plan is necessary, however, I have found that if you and your client are communicating and on the same page, these transitions are easily manageable.</p>

                <p>Oh, and if you are in the need for a custom designed door for your home or business, please go check out Mirabella Doors http://www.mirabelladoors.com/. Their motto is, "You only have one chance to make a first impression" and the doors that Pam Miller designs will make sure that first impression is memorable.</p>
