				<p>In this 2-day homework assignment, I was tasked with putting my newly acquired JavaScript skills to the test by creating a Trivia Game. Having been a fan of the reality TV show, Survivor, since it's inception, I could not think of a better topic to build my application around.</p>

				<p>This app was built using HTML and CSS, however, my primary focus was spent using JavaScript and jQuery to create the game's logic. The questions and answers were written as an array of objects and functions were used to start/stop the game, display questions, dynamically write to HTML, set timers and countdowns, and evaluate the player's answers as correct or incorrect.</p>

				<p>The main takeaway that I learned in developing this app was that computers are inherently dumb--they are not intuitive in nature and in order for an application to work correctly, the developer needs to be explicit and extremely detail oriented when writing code. It is a lot easier to tell a human to "ask the next question", for example, but a computer needs a step-by-step list of instructions in order to properly <i>function</i> (pun intended).</p>
