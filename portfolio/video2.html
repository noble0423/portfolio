                        <p>It's amazing what a chance encounter can develop into. In this case, I met Gabe Kelley in the lobby of my apartment complex and within the first 5 minutes of chatting, we discovered a mutual need for each other's business. You see, Gabe operates a luxury Pet Care Business...a Personal Pet Concierge if you will. Gabe needed a website to showcase his business and I needed help watching our Dog, Riley, while we were going on vacation to Florida!</p>
    
                        <p>We met several times and collaborated on a multitude of things, including the overall purpose of the website, needs and functionality of the site, design likes and dislikes, etc. We decided upon a single-page format where his existing and potential clients could see all of the Pet Care Services that his business provides, the pricing for those services, and the ability to book appointments.</p>
        
                        <p>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Animate.js, JavaScript, and jQuery were used for all of the front-end needs (everything that the user sees and interacts with). Never underestimate the power of design—providing an excellent User Experience is key because in a lot of cases, it provides that first impression. Gabe and I spent a lot of time deciding on the design of icons, colors used, pictures incorporated throughout the site, etc. These all combine to provide an emotional appeal in order to draw the customer in.</p>

                        <p>Aside from JavaScript, the back-end consists of PHP to handle the contact form and since Gabe is setup through Square for all of his invoicing and booking needs, we were able to seamlessly incorporate the Square Appointment widget directly into the site as opposed to navigating away from Gabe’s site in order to book appointments.</p>

                        <p>Gabe was another wonderful client to work with and his company, We Love All Pets, provides top-notch Pet Care Services in the inner-loop of Houston.
