				<p>Our final group project asked us to construct a full stack application using React.js as the primary framework and any other technology that we saw fit. The Woof Pack app aimed to partner like-minded pet owners in order share pet services like dog walking and dog sitting. And to make the app even more attractive, these services are traded between users which eliminates the need to fork over money.</p>

				<p>This React.js based app utilized HTML, CSS, and Materialize on the front-end while RESTful API’s (Node.js and Express) extracted meaningful data from back-end technology consisting of MongoDB, and once hosted, Heroku and JawsDB. Work item tracking, source control, and build management was conducted with Trello and GitHub.</p>

				<p>Developing this application really illustrated the need to thoroughly design the inner working of each component in order to fully take advantage of the efficiencies that React.js creates--a well thought out component can be used in multiple areas of the same application and potentially, future applications as well.</p>
