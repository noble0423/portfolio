				<p>Ryan's Burger Stand is a restaurant app that allows users to input the names of burgers that they would like to eat. Looks pretty easy at first glance, but quickly becomes rather complex as the layers of the onion are exposed.</p>

				<p>In addition to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end features, Handlebars was also utilized for creating some of the dynamic components seen by the user. Node.js, MySQL, and Express were used to communicate with the database built in MySQL--which is how the burgers are stored in either their "ordered" or "eaten" states. Finally, as a way to really understand the concept of Object Relational Mapping, I was tasked to build a homemade ORM for this app that would handle the specific database queries needed throughout the app's functionality.</p>

				<p>Other than the new code that was employed in this application, I learned that employing a MVC design pattern helps separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to and accepted from the user. It also creates efficiencies in your code because it can be reused, which is a wonderful characteristic of Handlebars as well.</p>
