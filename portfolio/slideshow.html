				<p>All we knew going into this 8-day assignment was that we needed to build a Full Stack application of our choosing. Our Board Game Discovery app was an idea that formed out of our initial brainstorming session. The app allows users to search our database as a way to discover potential board games to play based off of different search filters to meet the user's specific needs. Additionally, this app also allows users to add their favorite board games to our site further fostering a community of board game users that continue expanding the database.</p>

				<p>Our three-person team used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for our front-end framework and coded all of the models and logic (including API calls) using JavaScript and jQuery in order to communicate with our back-end database that was built in MySQL. Once the application was completed, it was hosted on Heroku, where it can still be used today.</p>

				<p>Aside from learning and utilizing new, advanced coding techniques, this project also provided an outlet to develop our programming skills in a group setting. Dividing tasks into front-end or back-end, and then creating specific branches in GitHub in order to code these tasks without stepping on each others toes, was a crucial learning experience that directly translates to a professional setting. When it comes to getting the job done on a deadline, managing group dynamics properly and efficiently is just as important as the actual coding itself.</p>
