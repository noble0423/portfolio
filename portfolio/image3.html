				<p>The Simpsons Memory Game application was part of an individual 2-day homework assignment where the user tries to pick all 12 Simpsons characters, without clicking the same one twice. Oh, and after each click the order in which the characters are displayed is switched at random.</p>

				<p>Since this exercise was designed to demonstrate how React.js can create dynamic applications by using/re-using components, a majority of the code was written using React.js. The App.js file handles the passing of stateful code to the components, while the components then interpret those changes in the form of props and render accordingly. CSS was used for the main page of the app as well as in conjunction with each individual component.</p> 

				<p>Other than learning the React.js framework itself, a key takeaway I learned while coding this application is that a properly configured component can be tremendously helpful when designing dynamic applications. Furthermore, that very same component can also be used across a number of applications with little to no changes needed--it simply takes in the new props and renders as programmed.</p>
