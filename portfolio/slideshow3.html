                    <p>After graduating from the Coding Bootcamp at UCLA, I moved back to Houston and started my own company, RMN Web Design LLC. An early client of mine came to me with the following scenario:</p>

                    <p id="moonmistScenarioPara">"I have a Wholesale Distribution company and I am looking for an E-Commerce site that will allow me to sell products to new and existing clientele both online, as well as in-person via Salespeople in the field. I am also needing the capability to track my inventory and since my inventory changes all of the time, this site needs to be simple enough for me to easily add/remove products as well as change prices and product images/descriptions at a moment's notice. Furthermore, this E-commerce site not only needs to be able to track the inventory located in my warehouse, but it also needs the ability to utilize multiple warehouses in order to monitor the inventory that is located on each of my Salespeople's trucks. Finally, I have very specific pricing needs that change from customer-to-customer/product-to-product, so I only want that particular customer's pricing to show once they are logged into the site. If the customer is not logged into the site, I do not want any prices to be visible."</p>
    
                    <p>Developing this application demonstrated the importance of being well versed in many different areas. Since the customer needed all of the content to be created from scratch, that allowed me to produce and edit each of the product photos, product descriptions, FAQ's, Shipping and Return Policies, and all of the other wording used throughout the site. I was able to use my previous experience in Sales, Marketing, and Operations to facilitate a multi-warehouse Inventory Tracking System (including custom SKU's and barcodes), invoice templates, multiple forms of payment via Payment Gateway, bulk importing of customers and their Customer-Specific Pricing, etc. Coding languages and frameworks used included HTML, CSS, JS, Liquid, and multiple 3rd party applications including a POS (Point-of-Sale) application to be used be the company's salespeople in the field.</p>
